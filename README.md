Peer review by Carlos Felipe: This program runs perfectly I found no bugs or formatting errors. I like how you could add floating values like 3.14 and it would still work. At the end if you don't put either "yes" or "no" it throws back a sassy comment, I thought that was funny. The terminal outputs could look a bit better stylistically but everything is good.
